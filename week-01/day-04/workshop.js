     -  or we can `add()` without parameters just increasing the counter's value by one
     -  and we can `get()` the current value as string
     -  also we can `reset()` the value to the initial value

# Pirates

Create a `Pirate` class.  While you can add other fields and methods, you must have these methods:-
 -  `drinkSomeRum()` - intoxicates the Pirate some
 -  `howsItGoingMate()` - when called, the Pirate replies, if `drinkSomeRun` was called:-
     -  0 to 4 times, "Pour me anudder!"
     -  else, "Arghh, I'ma Pirate. How d'ya d'ink its goin?", the pirate passes out and sleeps it off.

If you manage to get this far, then you can try to do the following.
     -  `die()` - this kills off the pirate, in which case, DrinkSomeRum, etc. just result in `he's dead`.
     -  `brawl(x)` - where pirate fights another pirate (if that other pirate is alive) and there's a 1/3 chance, 1 dies, the other dies or they both pass out.

And... if you get that far...

Add a parrot.

# The Pirate Ship

*The place for the Pirates*

 -  Create a `Ship` class.
 -  The `Ship` stores `Pirate`-s instances in a list as the crew and has one captain who is also a `Pirate`.
 -  When a ship is created it doesn't have a crew or a captain.
 -  The ship can be filled with pirates and a captain via `fillShip()` method.
     -  Filling the ship with a captain and random number of pirates.
 -  Ships should be represented in a nice way on command line including information about
     -  captains consumed rum, state (passed out / died)
     -  number of alive pirates in the crew
 -  Ships should have a method to battle other ships: `ship.battle(otherShip)`
     -  should return `true` if the actual ship (`this`) wins
     -  the ship should win if its calculated score is higher
     -  calculate score: Number of Alive pirates in the crew - Number of consumed rum by the captain
     -  The loser crew has a random number of losses (deaths).
     -  The winner captain and crew has a party, including a random number of rum :)

## BattleApp

 -  Create a `BattleApp` class, where you can fight with ships
 -  Create 2 ships, fill them with pirates
 -  Have a battle!

# Armada

 -  Create an `Armada` class
 -  Contains `Ship`-s as a list
 -  Have a `armada.war(otherArmada)` method where two armada can engage in war
     -  it should work like merge sort
     -  first ship from the first armada battles the first of the other
     -  the loser gets skipped so the next ship comes in play from that armada
     -  whichever armada gets to the end of its ships loses the war
     -  return `true` if `this` is the winner

## WarApp

 -  Create a `WarApp` class, where you can fight with armadas
 -  Create 2 armadas, fill them with ships
 -  Have a war!
