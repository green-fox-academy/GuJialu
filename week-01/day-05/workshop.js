# The Garden Application

The task is to create a garden application, so in your main method you should
create a garden with flowers and trees. The program should demonstrate an
example garden with two flowers (yellow and blue) and two trees (purple and
orange). In the example after creating them you should show the user, how the
garden looks like. After that the program should water the garden twice, first
with the amount of `40` then with `70`. And after every watering the user should
see the state of the garden as you can see in the output.

The output should look like this:

```text
The yellow Flower needs water
The blue Flower needs water
The purple Tree needs water
The orange Tree needs water

Watering with 40
The yellow Flower doesnt need water
The blue Flower doesnt need water
The purple Tree needs water
The orange Tree needs water

Watering with 70
The yellow Flower doesnt need water
The blue Flower doesnt need water
The purple Tree doesnt need water
The orange Tree doesnt need water
```

## Information on the elements

- The Garden
  - is able to hold unlimited amount of flowers or trees
  - when watering it should only water those what needs water with equally
    divided amount amongst them
  - eg. watering with 40 and 4 of them need water then each gets watered with 10
- The Flower
  - needs water if its current water amount is less then 5
  - when watering it the flower can only absorb the 75% of the water
  - eg. watering with 10 the flower's amount of water should only increase with
    7.5
- The Tree
  - needs water if its current water amount is less then 10
  - when watering it the tree can only absorb the 40% of the water
  - eg. watering with 10 the tree's amount of water should only increase with 4

# Aircraft Carrier

## Aircrafts

- Create a class that represents an aircraft
- There are 2 types of aircrafts: `F16` and `F35`
- Both aircrafts should keep track of their ammunition

### F16

- Max ammo: 8
- Base damage: 30

### F35

- Max ammo: 12
- Base damage: 50

All aircrafts should be created with an empty ammo storage

### Methods

#### fight

- It should use all the ammo (set it to 0) and it should return the damage it
  deals
- The damage dealt is calculated by multiplying the base damage by the
  ammunition

#### refill

- It should take a number as parameter and subtract as much ammo as possible
- It can't have more ammo than the number or the max ammo (can't get more ammo
  than what's coming from the parameter or the max ammo of the aircraft)
- It should return the remaining ammo
- Eg. Filling an empty F35 with `300` would completely fill the storage of the
  aircraft and would return the remaining `288`

#### getType

- It should return the type of the aircraft as a string

#### getStatus

- It should return a string like:
  `Type F35, Ammo: 10, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 500`

#### isPriority

- It should return if the aircraft is priority in the ammo fill queue. It's
  `true` for F35 and `false` for F16

## Carrier

Create a class that represents an aircraft-carrier

- The carrier should be able to store aircrafts
- Each carrier should have a store of ammo represented as number
- The initial ammo should be given by a parameter in its constructor
- The carrier also has a health point given in its constructor as well

### Methods

#### add

- It should take a new aircraft and add it to its storage

#### fill

- It should fill all the aircraft with ammo and subtract the needed ammo from
  the ammo storage
- If there is not enough ammo then it should start to fill the aircrafts with
  priority first
- If there is no ammo when this method is called, it should throw an exception

#### fight

- It should take another carrier as a reference parameter and fire all the ammo
  from the aircrafts to it, then subtract all the damage from its health points

#### getStatus

It should return a string about itself and all of its aircrafts' statuses in the
following format:

```text
HP: 5000, Aircraft count: 5, Ammo Storage: 2300, Total damage: 2280
Aircrafts:
Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
Type F16, Ammo: 8, Base Damage: 30, All Damage: 240
Type F16, Ammo: 8, Base Damage: 30, All Damage: 240
```

If the health points are 0 then it should return: `It's dead Jim :(`
